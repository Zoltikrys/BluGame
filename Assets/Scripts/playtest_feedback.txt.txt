player controller too slow -- tested speed to ~2.5 which seemed right
player controller too quick to turn -- would like slower turn speed
player controller doesn't have momentum -- would like momentum coming down ramps and starting movement

RGB goggles split into multiple pickups to increase sense of progression
Battery holders should have a battery indicator on top -- maybe for battery respawn add a circular(?) timer to show it respawning
Minimap would be cool with invisible doors marked with dotted lines or similar -- possibly with colour of goggles
RGB goggles need limited charges to stop player mashing all 3 colours on room entry

managed to boundary escape from the rgb goggle dispenser (rip)
some indication that the player has a magnet ability -- particle effects when using it (described as wibbly wobbly)

big enemy in rgb goggle room looked like it should be smashing blu because it has big arms

environment should guide player a little bit more towards objectives and rgb side rooms -- not outright telling player

camera needs to show more of the room

bug found: lighting on enemy in RGB room disappears when BLU goes to the top of the ramp (move the light out a tiny bit)

The puzzles weren't clear for the intro room. needs indicator for presure plates and different models for non magnetized boxes
magnetizer pulling things from behind and from too far away -- player felt like they could just hit M and solve the room

wasnt clear why player could be magnetised to the bigger boxes

liked both rgb and magnet ability

camera placement made it so that it was unclear that the player was the main robot

enemies too easy to evade

if spawns were working would have known where to go (my bad)

big robot, felt like the player was going to be lasered
smaller one was unclear (this is probably because they kill themself before you get to see what they do)
lasers were self explanatory

also would like momentum and dashing
